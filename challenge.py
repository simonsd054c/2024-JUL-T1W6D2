# Task
# Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

# If n is odd, print Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
# If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
# If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

# Input Format
# A single line containing a positive integer, n.

# Constraints
# 2 <= n <= 100

# Output Format
# Print Weird if the number is weird. Otherwise, print Not Weird.

# Sample Input
# 3
# Sample Output
# Weird

n = int(input("Enter a number between 2 and 100: "))

if n % 2 == 1:
    # Odd number
    print("Weird")
else:
    # Even number
    if n >= 2 and n <= 5:
        # in the inclusive range of 2 to 5
        print("Not Weird")
    elif n >= 6 and n <= 20:
        # in the inclusive range of 6 to 20
        print("Weird")
    else:
        # greater than 20
        print("Not Weird")
